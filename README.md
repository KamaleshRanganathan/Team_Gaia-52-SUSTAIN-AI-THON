# AI powered Fashion for a sustainable future

In today’s world, the fashion industry faces significant challenges in balancing profitability with sustainability. With growing concerns about environmental impact, overproduction, and waste, there is a strong need to encourage responsible consumption and production practices. Our project introduces an AI-powered sustainable fashion store that integrates an innovative virtual try-on feature to enhance the shopping experience while promoting sustainable behavior.

The platform allows users to try on outfits virtually using advanced AI algorithms, eliminating the need for physical trials and reducing product returns. Additionally, the store encourages customers to adopt sustainable practices by offering rewards for making eco-conscious purchases and reusing outfits. By combining  AI with sustainability-focused incentives, this project aims to align economic growth with environmental stewardship, contributing to a greener future.

## <ins>Why It Matters:</ins>
1. Environmental Impact: Reduces textile waste and carbon emissions caused by excessive returns and overproduction.

2. Economic Growth: Encourages innovation in the fashion industry by integrating AI solutions.

3. Consumer Empowerment: Provides users with an interactive and personalized shopping experience.

4. Sustainability Goals: Supports responsible consumption patterns and promotes eco-friendly behavior.

This project seamlessly aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly:

* **SDG 8:** Decent Work and Economic Growth.
* **SDG 9:** Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure.
* **SDG 12:** Responsible Consumption and Production.
By blending technology, innovation, and sustainability, this project creates a practical solution for a pressing global issue while providing a delightful user experience.

## <ins>Tech Stack:</ins>
The project leverages a fully frontend-focused stack to achieve functionality and performance without relying on backend infrastructure. Here’s the detailed breakdown:
1. Frontend Framework:

* **Svelte:** A lightweight, modern JavaScript framework that ensures fast performance and reactivity. It simplifies building interactive user interfaces while maintaining a clean codebase.
Tailwind CSS: Used for styling, providing utility-first, responsive designs to deliver a seamless user experience.

2. Hosting:

* **Git:** For deploying the static Svelte application. These platforms ensure fast, reliable, and scalable hosting.

## <ins>Novelty:</ins>
This project stands out due to its unique blend of sustainability and technology. Here’s why it is novel:

1. Frontend-Only Virtual Try-On:

By using browser-based AI (TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe), the project eliminates the need for expensive backend servers, making it lightweight and cost-effective while delivering realistic try-on results.

2. Sustainability Rewards System:

A unique reward system incentivizes eco-friendly choices by awarding points for selecting sustainable products. These points can be redeemed for discounts, encouraging responsible shopping behavior.

3. AI Recommendations for Sustainability:

AI suggests sustainable alternatives to selected items, making users more aware of eco-friendly options. This feature is not commonly found in traditional virtual try-on platforms.

4. Interactive and Engaging Shopping:

The platform integrates AI to create a personalized, immersive shopping experience while promoting sustainability—a rare combination in the fashion industry.

5. No Backend Dependency:

The project’s reliance on a fully frontend architecture simplifies implementation and deployment, making it accessible to small and medium-sized businesses interested in adopting similar solutions.

## <ins>Solution:<ins>
This project provides a holistic solution to tackle the challenges of sustainability in the fashion industry while enhancing the user experience. Here’s how it works:

1. User-Friendly Shopping Platform:

Customers can browse a wide range of sustainable fashion items categorized by tags like "Recycled Fabric," "Low Carbon Footprint," and "Upcycled Material."

2. AI-Powered Virtual Try-On:

Users upload their photo and virtually try on outfits to see how they look before purchasing.
AI overlays the selected clothing on the user’s body with realistic transformations and alignment, increasing purchase confidence and reducing returns.

3. Sustainability Incentives:

For every sustainable purchase, users earn reward points tracked in their browser (using localStorage). These points can be redeemed for discounts or other benefits, motivating eco-friendly choices.

4. Dynamic AI Recommendations:

The system uses static catalog data to suggest alternatives that are more sustainable or align better with the user’s preferences.

5. Eco-Friendly Checkout:

At checkout, users are encouraged to reuse packaging, recycle old clothes, or donate, with additional rewards for completing these actions.

6. Technology-Driven Impact:

By combining AI-powered features and sustainability incentives, the solution reduces the environmental impact of the fashion industry, lowers return rates, and fosters a community of eco-conscious consumers.
